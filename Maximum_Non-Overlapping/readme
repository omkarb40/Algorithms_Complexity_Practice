# Maximum_Non-Overlapping Task

You are given N tasks, each with a start time and finish time. Some of these tasks have overlapping intervals. Your task is to find the maximum number of non-overlapping tasks that can be scheduled using the Earliest Finish Time strategy.

### Input Format

- The first line contains an integer N, the number of tasks.
- The next N lines contain two integers each, start_time and finish_time, representing the start and finish times of the task.

### Constraints

- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ start_time ≤ finish_time ≤ 10⁹

### Output Format

Print a single integer, which is the maximum number of non-overlapping tasks that can be scheduled.
