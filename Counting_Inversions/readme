# Counting Inversions in Movie Rankings

## Overview

This program calculates how different a user's ranking of movies is from the 
global ranking using inversion counting.

## Files included

- count_inversions.py → Contains the implementation.
- README.md → This file.

## How to run
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
- Navigate to the folder containing the script.
- Run the script using:
python count_inversions.py

### Example Input & Output

#### Input
A = [3, 1, 2]
B = [2, 3, 1]
N = 3

#### Expected Output
Number of inversions: 2

### Algorithm Explanation
- Convert B to a position mapping.
- Transform A into a ranked list.
- Use Merge Sort to count inversions.

### Time Complexity
Mapping B: O(N)
Transforming A: O(N)
Merge Sort: O(N log N)

Total Complexity: O(NlogN)
